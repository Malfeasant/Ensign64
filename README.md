Another Commodore 64 emulator

Why another one?  I don't expect to do better than any of the many out there, this is more an exercise- an excuse even. The intent is to learn about coding, and learn about the inner workings of a cpu, even a simple one... but this will probably end up being more of a visual simulator than an emulator...
